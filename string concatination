/*A string is called a pString if it can be represented as p concatenated copies of some string. For example, the string "aabaabaabaab" is at the same time a 1String, a 2String and a 4String, but it is not a 3String, a 5String, or a 6String and so on. Obviously any string is a 1String.

You are given a string s, consisting of lowercase English letters and a positive integer p. Your task is to find if it is possible to reorder the letters in the string s in such a way that the resulting string is a pString.

Input Format

The first input line contains integer p. 
The second line contains s, all characters in s are lowercase English letters.

Constraints

1 ≤ p ≤ 1000
1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000

Output Format

Print "YES" if it is possible to rearrange the letters in string s in such a way that the result is a pString. Print the result on a single output line. If it is not possible print "NO". (without quotes).
